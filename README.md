The application is built on top of [**Next.js**](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) -_a framework for server-rendered React apps_- and was created starting from the template created with [**nextjs-starter**](https://github.com/iaincollins/nextjs-starter) -_a starter project for Next.js with oAuth and email based authentication_-
